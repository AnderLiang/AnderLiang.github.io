# Hi, I'm **ZhonXuan Liang**  
**Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Graphics**  
*University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)*  
*Since 2024*  

---

## Research Highlights  
- **First-author paper accepted by SIGGRAPH 2025**  
  *"Field Smoothness-Controlled Partition for Quadrangulation"*  
  - Proposes novel partition method for reliable feature-aligned quadrangulation  
  - Core insight: Smooth streamlines distant from singularities are more suitable as patch boundaries  
  - Key innovations:  
    • Singularities enclosed within patches for straighter boundaries  
    • New patch quality control mechanism maintaining boundaries in high smoothness regions  
    • Practical algorithm combining iterative path tracing and path removal  
  - Demonstrated effectiveness:  
    • Generates quality quad meshes on massive test datasets  
    • Compared with SOTA methods:  
      - 30%+ quality improvement in quad meshes  
      - Maintains similar reliability
